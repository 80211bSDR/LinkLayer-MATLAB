<p>LinkLayer-MATLAB is a IEEE 802.11b Standard Compliant Link Layer (PHY and MAC layer) for MATLAB-based SDR. The code is highly modular and is entirely written in MATLAB. See each file for further documentation. The default settings in the files work well with our N210s using WBX daughterboards.</p>

<p>We model our system using a finite state machine (FSM) that transitions only on the clock cycles derived from the USRP clock, allowing for slot-time synchronized operations, thereby eliminating the need for external clocks. Futhermore, the model helps create a state-action based system design, wherein the same node switches between transmitter and receiver functions.</p>

<p>We adopt the IEEE 802.11b PHY and MAC layer packet structure specifications in our implementation. Our approach collects all the bits in the packet in multiples of 8 octets, which forms one USRP frame. This makes it easy for us to work with the MATLAB system objects and with PHY and MAC header fields in the DATA/ACK packet that happen to have sizes that are multiples of 8 octets. Multiple USRP frames will compose the standard-compliant 802.11b packet.</p>

<p>We implement <strong>DBPSK</strong> (differential binary phase shift keying) and <strong>DSSS</strong> direct sequence spread spectrum at the PHY layer and <strong>CSMA/CA</strong> (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) at the MAC layer.</p>

<p>The consistent performance of the two node (1 DTx and 1 DRx; essentially a bi-directional link) and the three node (2 DTxs and 1 DRx) experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the system in mitigating packet collisions and enforcing fairness among nodes when accessing a common channel.</p>

<p>The current work provides a testbed to experiment with and enables creation of new MAC protocols starting from the fundamental IEEE 802.11b compliant standard.</p>
